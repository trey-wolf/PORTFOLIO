"""
Objective: Create a compass rose with four lines pointing
North, East, South, and West from the center of the screen.
Each line should be a different color.

Your Challenge: This drawing requires you to use what you've learned about
turtle's default direction, how to change its direction, and how to control its movement and pen.

Think about how you can draw each of the four lines. How can you:

        Start each line from the same central point?

        Turn the turtle to face a new direction for each line (North, East, South, and West)?

        Use color() to make each line unique?

import turtle

# Create a turtle named Timmy
timmy = turtle.Turtle()
timmy.speed(5)
timmy.pensize(3)

# Write your code below this comment


# OPTIONAL EXPANSION
# After you have north, east, south and west lines
# Create 4 smaller lines showing northeast, southeast, southwest and northwest.
# Make the colors a blend between each base direction
# For example if north and east and blue and red respectively, make northeast purple.
