# Practice: User Input
#
# This practice file will test your ability to use the input() function to get
# data from the user and cast it to the correct data type for calculations.
#

# --- Practice Problems ---

# Problem 1: Ask the user for their favorite color and print a response that says, "Your favorite color is [color]!"
# Use a variable to store the user's input.


# Problem 2: Ask the user for their age and store it in a variable. Then, print the variable to the console.
# What data type is the age variable? Add a comment with your answer.


# Problem 3: Ask the user to enter a number. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable called 'num'.
# Print the value of 'num' multiplied by 5.


# Problem 4: Ask the user for the price of an item and store it as a float.
# Then, calculate and print the price including a 5% tax.
# Example: If the user enters 10, the output should be 10.5.


# Problem 5: Ask the user for their name and their favorite number.
# Print a single message using an f-string that includes both pieces of information.
# Example: "Hi John, your favorite number is 7!"


# --- Challenge Problem ---

# Problem: Create a simple calculator that asks the user for two numbers.
# The program should then print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.
# Remember to cast the input to the correct data type for the calculations!

# OPTIONAL Extension: Extend the calculator to do exponentiation, modulo, and floor division.
