# Practice: Math Operators & Type Casting
#
# This practice file will test your understanding of Python's math operators
# and how to cast variables between different data types.
#

# --- Practice Problems ---

# Problem 1: Use the math operators to perform the following calculations and print the result for each:
#   - 12 plus 5
#   - 10 minus 3
#   - 4 times 8
#   - 15 divided by 4


# Problem 2: Use the floor division operator (//) to divide 17 by 5 and print the result.
# What is the final data type of the result? Add a comment with your answer.
# you can use print(type(YOUR_VARIABLE_HERE)) to show you the exact data type


# Problem 3: Use the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder of 25 divided by 7. Print the result.


# Problem 4: Write a single line of code that raises 3 to the power of 4 and prints the result.


# Problem 5: Convert the integer variable `age = 22` to a string.
# Store the result in a new variable called `age_str` and print it.


# --- Challenge Problem ---

# Problem: Create a program that calculates how many full pizzas you will need to order and how many slices are left over.
# Ask the user for the total number of people and the number of slices per pizza.
# Assume each person eats 3 slices.
# Use floor division (//) to find the number of full pizzas needed.
# Use the modulo operator (%) to find the number of remaining slices.
# Print a clear message that shows both results.
#
# OPTIONAL extension: Include a cost analysis of the pizza's ordered.
# Give the option to the user to include how much the pizza will cost (as a float).
# Use this value to see how much it would cost and how much each person would need to pay to share.

# Write your code below:
