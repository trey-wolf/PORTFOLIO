# Practice: Output and Escape Sequences
#
# This practice file will test your knowledge of the print() function
# and using escape sequences to format your output.
#

# --- Practice Problems ---

# Problem 1: Use a single print statement to print the word "Python" on one line and the word "Programming" on the next line.


# Problem 2: Print your first name, followed by a tab, and then your last name.


# Problem 3: Print the message: "This is a quote: \"Hello!\""
# Use escape sequences to include the double quotes inside the string.


# Problem 4: Print a literal backslash. The output should look like this: \


# Problem 5: Use a single print statement and a combination of '\n' and '\t' to print the following output:
# Languages:
#     - Python
#     - Java
#     - C++


# --- Challenge Problem ---

# Problem: Create a program that prints a simple menu for a coffee shop.
# The menu should have 5 items with their prices, aligned neatly using tabs.
# Use a title for the menu and separate it from the items with a blank line.

# Example Output:
# --- COFFEE MENU ---
#
# Coffee		$2.50
# Latte		    $3.75
#      ...etc...

# OPTIONAL Extension: In your menu, 3 different sections to separate out food, drinks and add-ons
# Have at least 3 options for each food, drink and add-on
# An add-on could be something like an extra shot of espresso, almond milk, etc.
