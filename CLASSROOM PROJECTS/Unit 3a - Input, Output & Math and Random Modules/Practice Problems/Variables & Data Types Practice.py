# Practice: Variables and Data Types
#
# This practice file will test your knowledge of creating variables and understanding
# the three basic data types: string, integer, and float.
#

# --- Practice Problems ---

# Problem 1: Create a variable called 'favorite_food' and assign it your favorite food as a string.
# Then, print the variable.


# Problem 2: Create a variable called 'current_year' and assign it the current year as an integer.
# Then, print the variable.


# Problem 3: Create a variable called 'daily_temp' and assign it a temperature with a decimal point (e.g., 72.5) as a float.
# Then, print the variable.


# Problem 4: Create a string variable called 'greeting_part1' with the value "Hello" and a string variable called 'greeting_part2' with the value "World".
# Print both variables on the same line using a single print statement.


# Problem 5: Find the error in the following code and fix it.
# You should be able to print the value of 'my_number'.
# my-number = 10
# print(my-number)


# --- Challenge Problem ---

# Write a simple mad-lib that incorporates at least 10 different variables.
# You can use the example mad lib or write your own.

# In its current state this code will cause an Error because the f-strings are incorrect...
# print(f"Once upon a time, a scientist named `name` had a very `adjective` problem.")
# print(f"His favorite `noun` had gone missing!")
# print(f"To find it, he `verb` all the way to `place`.")
# print(f"He searched `adverb` for his lost item.")
# print(f"Suddenly, he spotted a mischievous `animal`.")
# print(f"The creature was holding not one, but `number` of his missing items!")
# print(f"The `animal` dropped them with a loud `sound`!")
# print(f"`name` was `emotion` to get his things back.")
# print(f"He picked them all up and went back home to make some tea.")
# print("The end.")

# Write your code below:
