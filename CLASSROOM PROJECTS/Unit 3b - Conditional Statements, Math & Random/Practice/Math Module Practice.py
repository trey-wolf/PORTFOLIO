# Day 4: Math Module Practice

# Problem 0: Import the math module
# Write the code necessary to import the math module


# Problem 1: Calculate the square root.
# Calculate the square root of 225 and print the result.


# Problem 2: Calculate a number to a power.
# Calculate 8 raised to the power of 3 and print the result.


# Problem 3: Round a number up.
# Use math.ceil() to round the number 9.1 up to the nearest integer.


# Problem 4: Find the greatest common divisor.
# Find the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24.


# Problem 5: Use Pi in a calculation.
# Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 7 using math.pi.
# The formula is Area = pi * r^2.
radius = 7


# Problem 6: Round a number down.
# Use math.floor() to round the number 25.8 down to the nearest integer.


# --- Challenge Problem: The Tile Project ---
# You are tiling a rectangular room and want to use the largest possible square
# tiles without having to cut any. The side length of the square tiles will be the
# greatest common divisor (GCD) of the room's length and width.
#
# 1. Use math.gcd() to find the side length of the largest possible square tile.
#    The room's dimensions are 120 inches by 80 inches.
# 2. Store the result in a variable called 'tile_size'.
# 3. Print the 'tile_size' in a clear, descriptive sentence.
# 4. As an extra step, calculate how many tiles are needed to cover the room.
#    (Hint: Divide the room's total area by the tile's total area.)

room_length = 120
room_width = 80

# Your code here

# Calculate how many tiles are needed

# OPTIONAL EXTENSION: Rewrite your code (refactor) such that a user can decide
# How much the room_length and room_width are before deciding the tiles
