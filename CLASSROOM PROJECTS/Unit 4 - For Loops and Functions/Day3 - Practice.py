# Day 3 Practice: Defining and Calling Functions
# ======================================================================
# Instructions:
# - For Part 1, complete the code by writing the functions as described.
# - For Part 2, predict the output of the given code blocks without
#   running them first. Write your answers in a comment.
# - The solutions are at the bottom of the file.
# ======================================================================

## Part 1: Syntax Practice - Writing Your Own Functions
# For these problems, your goal is to practice the `def` syntax.

# ---
# Problem 1: Tell a Joke
# ---
# Define a function called `tell_joke`. When called, this function should
# print a simple, two-line joke to the console. After you define it,
# call the function to make sure it works.

# WRITE YOUR CODE FOR PROBLEM 1 HERE

# Call the function
print("--- Problem 1 ---")

# ---
# Problem 2: Display a Numbered List
# ---
# Define a function called `show_steps`. Inside this function, use a `for`
# loop that runs 3 times. In each iteration, it should print a message like
# "Step 1", "Step 2", and "Step 3". Call the function after defining it.

# WRITE YOUR CODE FOR PROBLEM 2 HERE

# Call the function
print("\n--- Problem 2 ---")

# ---
# Problem 3: Flip a Coin
# ---
# Import the `random` module. Define a function called `flip_coin`.
# Inside the function, generate a random integer that is either 0 or 1.
# If the number is 1, print "Heads!". If it's 0, print "Tails!".
# Call the function twice to see different results.

# WRITE YOUR CODE FOR PROBLEM 3 HERE

# Call the function
print("\n--- Problem 3 ---")

# ======================================================================
## Part 2: Evaluation Practice - Predicting the Output
# For these problems, trace the code execution in your head or on paper.

# ---
# Problem 4: Tracing Execution Flow
# ---
# Read the code below. What will be the exact output when this script is run?
# Don't run the code until you have an answer!
# Uncomment the code to run it, check your prediction

"""
def print_message():
    print("Inside the function.")

print("Start of the program.")
print_message()
print("End of the program.")
"""

# PREDICT THE OUTPUT FOR PROBLEM 4 HERE:
#
# My Prediction:


# ---
# Problem 5: Multiple Function Calls
# ---
# Read the code below. What will the exact output be? Pay close attention
# to the order of the function calls.
# Uncomment the code to run it, check your prediction

    print("Performing Action A.")

print("Let's do B again.")
