Unit 5: Lists - Day 1 Challenge Problem
========================================

Instructions:
Solve the challenge problem below by writing your code 
in the designated '# TODO' section.

---
Challenge: The "Pass/Fail" Checker
---

1.  **Create a list** called `quiz_scores` that contains the 
    following five integer scores: 88, 65, 92, 74, 81

2.  **Access** the score for the second and third quiz (remember, indices 
    start at 0!). Put them in their own variables.

3.  **Use an `if` statement** to check if one of those scores is 
    greater than or equal to 70.

    * If one of them are, print: "The student passed one of those quizzes!"
    * If both are not, print: "The student did not pass either quiz."
