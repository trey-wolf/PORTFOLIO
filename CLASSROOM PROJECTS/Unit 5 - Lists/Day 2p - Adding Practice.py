"""

# --- len() Practice ---

# Problem 1:
# You are given a list of groceries.
# Find the length (number of items) of the `groceries` list.
groceries = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread", "Apples", "Chicken"]
# Find the length of the `groceries` list.



# Problem 2:
# Create a list named `class_periods` with all of your class period names, in order.
# Then, find the length of the `class_periods` list and print it.
# Create the list and find its length.



# --- .append() Practice ---

# Problem 3:
# Create an empty list called `colors`.
# On three separate lines, append the following items to `colors`
# in this order: "Red", "Green", "Blue".
# Write your code here.



# Problem 4:
# You are given a list of `planets`.
# Append the rest of the planets (in order) to the end of the `planets` list.
planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars"]
# Append "Jupiter" to the `planets` list.



# Problem 5:
# Create an empty list called `scores`.
# Append the integers 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 to the `scores` list.
# Write your code here.


# --- .insert() Practice ---

# Problem 6:
# You are given a list of `winners`.
# Insert the string "Alice" at the very beginning of the list (index 0).
winners = ["Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
# Insert "Alice" at index 0.



# Problem 7:
# You are given a list of `letters`.
# Insert the string "B" at index 1 to put it between "A" and "C".
# Then insert the string "F" at the end of the list.
# When you insert at the end of the list, does it work the same way as appending??
letters = ["A", "C", "D"]
# Insert "B" at index 1.



# Problem 8:
# You are given a `waitlist`.
# Insert your name at index 2 in the list.
waitlist = ["Ian", "Jack", "Kate", "Liam"]
# Insert "Hannah" at index 2.



# Problem 9:
# Create an empty list called `my_steps`.
# First, append the string "Step 1".
# Second, append the string "Step 3".
# Finally, use .insert() to add "Step 2" in the correct position.
# Write your code here.
