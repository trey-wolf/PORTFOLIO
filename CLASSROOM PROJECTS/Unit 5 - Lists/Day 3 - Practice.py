Write your code beneath each problem's instructions.
"""

# ========================================
# Problem 1: Calculate the Average
# ========================================
# Given the list:
nums = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Write a loop to calculate the sum of all the items.
# After the loop, print the average of the list (sum divided by the number of items).

# Write your code for problem 1 here:



# ========================================
# Problem 2: Filter a List
# ========================================
# Given the list:
all_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Write an loop that creates a **new list** called `evens`
# which contains only the even numbers from the `all_numbers` list.
# Print the `evens` list after your loop is finished.

# Write your code for problem 2 here:



# ========================================
# Problem 3: Count Occurrences
# ========================================
# Given the list:
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'cow', 'cat', 'pig', 'cat']

# Write a loop to count how many times the string 'cat' appears.
# Print the final count.

# Write your code for problem 3 here:



# ========================================
# Problem 4: Print with Index
# ========================================
# Given the list:
shopping_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Write a loop that uses `range()` and `len()` to print each item *and* its index.
# The output should look like this:
# 0: apple
# 1: banana
# 2: cherry

# Write your code for problem 4 here:



# ========================================
# Problem 5: Find the Largest Number
# ========================================
# Given the list:
scores = [10, 55, 23, 8, 72, 40]

# Write a loop to find the largest number in the list.
# Print the largest number at the end.
# (Hint: You'll need a variable outside the loop to keep track
# of the largest number you've seen so far.)

# Write your code for problem 5 here:
