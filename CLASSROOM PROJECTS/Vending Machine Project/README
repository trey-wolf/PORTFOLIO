# Vending Machine Simulator

This repository contains a simple, text-based vending machine simulator written in Python. It's a procedural program that allows users to interact with a virtual vending machine by inserting money, selecting items, and receiving change. It also includes a password-protected admin function for restocking items.

## About This Program

The script simulates the core functions of a vending machine.

  * **View Items:** Displays a list of available items, including their price and current stock.
  * **Insert Money:** Allows the user to add to their current balance.
  * **Select Item:** Lets the user purchase an item. The program checks if the item is in stock and if the user has sufficient funds.
  * **Dispense Change:** If a purchase is successful, the machine "dispenses" the item and returns any remaining change, setting the balance back to zero.
  * **Admin Restock:** A password-protected option (`3`) allows an administrator to add stock to any item. (The default password is **`1234`**).
  * **Quit:** Exits the program and returns any remaining balance to the user.

## How to Run

This program does not require any external libraries. You only need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

1.  Make sure you have the `VendingMachineFinished.py` file on your computer.
2.  Open your terminal (like Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/directory
    ```
4.  Run the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python VendingMachineFinished.py
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to use `python3` instead of `python` depending on your system's configuration.)*

## How to Use

Once the program is running, you will see a menu with four options:

### 1: Insert money

  * Select this option to add funds to your balance.
  * You will be prompted to enter a monetary amount (e.g., `5`, `1.50`).

### 2: Select item

  * Select this option to make a purchase.
  * You will be prompted to enter the item number (e.g., `1` for Chips).
  * If you have enough money and the item is in stock, the purchase will be successful. Your change will be displayed, and your balance will be reset to $0.
  * If the item is out of stock or you don't have enough money, an error message will be shown, and you will be returned to the main menu.

### 3: Restock items (Admin only)

  * This option is for machine administrators.
  * You will be prompted to enter a 4-digit admin password. The default password is **`1234`**.
  * If the password is correct, you will see the item list again and be asked which item to restock.
  * After selecting an item, you will be asked how many units to add.

### 4: Quit

  * This will stop the program.
  * If you have any remaining balance, it will be "returned" to you with a final message.
